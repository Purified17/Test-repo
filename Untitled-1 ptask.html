// For Loop Example 1: Printing numbers from 0 to 4
// This loop initializes a counter variable 'i' to 0.

// For Loop Example 2: Iterating through an array
// This loop iterates over each element in the 'colors' array.
// The loop variable 'i' represents the index of the current element.

// While Loop Example 1: Counting down from 5 to 1
// This loop continues as long as the 'count' variable is greater than 0.
// In each iteration, the current value of 'count' is printed, and then 'count' is decremented.
let count = 5;

// This loop continues to prompt the user for input until they enter "yes".

// This loop will execute the code inside the 'do' block at least once,
// even if the condition in the 'while' part is initially false.
let num = 0;

// Do...While Loop Example 2: Getting valid input from the user
// This loop continues to prompt the user for a number until they enter a value greater than 10.
